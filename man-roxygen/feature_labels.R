#' @param feature_labels A named list of \dQuote{fancy} feature labels to be used in output. By default, the function looks for a \dQuote{label} attribute on each variable in \code{formula} and uses that for pretty printing. This argument overrides those attributes or otherwise provides fancy labels for this purpose. This should be a list with names equal to variables on the righthand side of \code{formula} and character string values; arguments passed here override variable attributes.
